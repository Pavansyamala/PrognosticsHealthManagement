# IIT Kharagpur Internship Repository

## Project: Prognostics and Health Management of Railway Assets

### Overview
This repository contains the work done during my internship at **Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur**, focusing on predictive maintenance and sensor forecasting for railway assets. The primary goal was to develop deep learning models to estimate the **Remaining Useful Lifetime (RUL)** of assets and improve forecasting accuracy for multiple sensor signals.

### Key Contributions
- **RNN Model**: Developed a deep learning model for RUL prediction, achieving a **Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 27.56**.
- **Artificial Neural Network (ANN) Model**: Implemented an ANN-based approach, achieving an **RMSE of 40.98**.
- **Multiple Time Series Forecasting**: Used **Temporal Fusion Transformers (TFT)** to predict sensor data trends, achieving an **RMSE of 78.89**.
- **Feature Engineering & Data Preprocessing**: Optimized input features to improve model performance.

### Technologies Used
- Python
- TensorFlow / PyTorch
- XGBoost
- Temporal Fusion Transformers (TFT)
- Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib
- Sklearn
- Time Series Forecasting
